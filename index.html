        <blockquote class="about__quote-text">“To me, fashion expresses a point of view where formality and informality,
        construction and comfort co-exist. My ethos is about the luxury of infusing clothes with your own personality,
        not being worn by them,”

      <p class="about__text">Matthew M. Williams reveals his vision with help from an all-star lineup of likeminded
        artists. The Creative Director called on close friends in his tight-knit community of artists. Kendall Jenner,
        Bella Hadid, Playboi Carti and the supermodels Anok Yai and Liam Powers were each invited to put their own stamp
        on key pieces, the better to highlight the importance of cultivating a powerful personal style.
